# Business Architecture

A Business Architecture defines the structure of your organization in
terms of its governance structure, business processes, business services
and products, business information and stakeholders. A business
architecture outlines the relation to strategic goals towards a working
system. So in short a business architecture can be regarded as a
blueprint of the working of an organization. By using a business
architecture your organisation can handle changes and problems with less
cost and in less time since you know all the important dependencies,
relation and information flows.  Every successful organisation, small or
large, SHOULD have a business architecture. A business architecture does
not have to be fully descriptive, complete or created among a certain
standard. Designing organisations and describing the working of an
organisation is know to be complex and hard. However simple tools exist
to create a meaningful business architecture for your organisation.

This section is created to speed up the process for creating a real
business architecture.

You can use one of the following tools:

-   Business architecture template(s)
-   (Re)use  business principles
-   Modeling your business processes
-   Defining your business products

## Tools for creating a business architecture

To speed up the process of creating your business architecture you can
make use of one of the following tools:

-   [Collection](https://principles.design/) of many nice design
    principles used by companies (180+ examples).

-   [Archi](http://www.archimatetool.com/).  Archi™ GUI tool for
    creating a business architecture using the ArchiMate modelling™
    language. The Archi tool is targeted toward all levels of
    Architects. The tool is MIT Licensed, so it provides a low cost
    solution to users who are looking for a free, open ArchiMate
    modeling tool.

    Warning: Using archimate is in essence not agile. So mainly large
    corporations and governments use it. Archimate is an Enterprise
    Architecture (EA) modelling language. So not suited for software
    modelling and software engineering. It is however very good for
    business modelling and creating high level relations to IT systems.

-   [Causal Loop Diagram](https://nocomplexity.com/causalloopdiagram/).
    Tool to make easy causal loop diagrams in your browser. A causal
    loop diagram (CLD) is a causal diagram that aids in visualizing how
    different variables in a system are interrelated. This FOSS tool has
    an nice animation to presents effects also! The original (OSS)
    source can be found [here](https://github.com/ncase/loopy). But the
    version on
    [NOComplexity.com](https://nocomplexity.com/causalloopdiagram) is a
    (GPL) fork with some extra features ( [source
    code](https://github.com/nocomplexity/causalloopdiagram/) ).

-   [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.org/download/modeler/). Camunda
    Modeler is an OSS desktop application for editing BPMN process
    diagrams(2.0) and DMN decision tables. Business Process Model and
    Notation (BPMN) is the global standard for process modeling and one
    of the most important components of successful
    Business-IT-Alignment. BPMN is an open standard. But there are not
    many good OSS available packages available. Camunda Modeler is an
    OSS BPMN solution and is part of an open source platform for
    workflow and business process management. So when you use the
    [Camunda Suite](https://camunda.org/) you can also use the execution
    engine for your processes you have modeled.

-   [Protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu/). Protégé is an OSS web or
    desktop application that can be used for building business
    ontologies.


```{admonition} Architectural Decision Records 
:class: tip, dropdown
An Architectural Decision (AD) is a justified design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant.
This great toolkit with templates makes collection, storing and using ADRs simple.

Check: [Architectural Decision Records - Playbook](https://adr.github.io/)

Repository on [Github](https://github.com/adr)
```

### Drawing tools

Beside advanced real architecture modelling tools, many architects SHOULD use also simple drawing tools to communicate architectures and designs.
Creating sketches in the only mature FOSS Office Suite [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/) is a good and simple way to make views for all kinds of stakeholders. Some FOSS drawing tools can be used to create views using all kinds of commonly used standards, like Archimate, UML or BPMN. Noting beats a simple fast drawing tool if there is no time, budget or experience using an advanced architecture modelling suite. 

*   [DrawIO](https://www.draw.io/). A online FOSS program to create
    diagrams. Its a very advanced, but also very simple to use program
    to create all types of (business) diagrams. UML, BPMN, ArchiMate,
    swimlane diagrams and many more. If you like to create good diagrams
    fast, think of using this program. Since its FOSS the source can be
    found on <https://github.com/jgraph/drawio> if you want to host it
    yourself. There is also a desktop version (electron build) of
    draw.io. Check <https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop>.

* [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) An open source virtual hand-drawn style whiteboard.
Collaborative and end-to-end encrypted. 

## Business architecture templates

Creating a business architecture means doing real business research.
However for a quality business architecture it make sense to make use of
a draft template. From a template you can easily add, remove or change
subjects that need special attention within your context. Also since
architecture documents always should be created for a clear business
goal and to be used by different stakeholders, all quality documents
SHOULD contain some default reusable text blocks.

-   [Basic business architecture
    template](https://nocomplexity.com/basic-business-architecture-template/)
-   [Stakeholder
    template](https://nocomplexity.com/stakeholder-template/)
-   [Business
    Architecture.](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/system/files/BA%20for%20validation.pdf_en)
    EU template/document that describes the product, service strategy,
    organizational, functional, process, information, and geographic
    aspects of the business architecture.
-   [Business Architecture Document
    Template.](http://opensdlc.org/support-files/SDLC-RUP-Control-of-Quality-Records.pdf)
    Typical Togaf(tm) like business architecture template.

 

## Using business viewpoints

Viewpoints can provide benefit to address specific concerns for certain
stakeholders. Below a list of most used viewpoint within a business
architecture:

-   Motivation view: describes what the business achieves for itself and
    its stakeholders (direct and indirect value).
-   Capability view: describes how the business delivers direct and
    indirect value in response to the challenges of the environment.
-   Activity view: describes the day-to-day behaviour of the business.
-   Responsibility view: captures the relationships between individuals
    and organizations in terms of responsibilities and commitments.
    These  relationships and organizational interfaces may be
    represented as business services.
